Madlibs Games in Python

Overview:

This Python script reads a story from a text file (story.txt) and identifies placeholders enclosed in < and >. It then prompts the user to input words to replace these placeholders and prints the replacements, creating a fun and customized version of the story, similar to a Madlibs game.

How to Use:

    Prepare the story file:
        Create a file named story.txt.
        Write a story in the file with placeholders enclosed in < and > (e.g., <noun>, <verb>).

    Run the script:
        Execute the script in a Python environment.
        The script will read and print the story from the file.
        It will identify all unique placeholders and prompt you to input a replacement word for each placeholder.
        After you provide the replacements, the script will print the dictionary of placeholders and their replacements.

Notes:

    Ensure the story.txt file is in the same directory as the script.
    The script currently supports placeholders enclosed in < and >.

Dependencies:
